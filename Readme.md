Problem set 0

I was able to successfuly figure out the rest of the problem sets except for Exercise 7. 
Exercise 7 is the hardest part of this entire problem set, even after looking online, i still couldn't figure it out for awhile
but then, I looked at code from stack overflow and eventually found out what I was missing.

For exercise 7, make sure that your input is between 0.7 and 0.9. You can enter in random numbers such as 1389034287402430 which will make the output give you an A. 
anything below 0.5 gives you an F in the program.
Exercise 4: The purpose of the def keyword in Python is to indicate the start of a function and for the following indented section of code to be stored for later.
